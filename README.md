# Capstone_project
For my capstone project i have decided to create an emoji guessing game,
where emoji representations of famous movies are displayed for the user to guess.

The game presents players an option to guess the movie based on the emojis,
or they can get a hint or they can skip a question they are stuck on.

Through the process of creating this game i have imporved my personal use of the following practises:
- Input handling
- Loops and confitionals
- Functions
- Data structures
- User interaction in the terminal
